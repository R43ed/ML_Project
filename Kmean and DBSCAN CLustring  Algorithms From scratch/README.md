# Kmean and DBSCAN Clustring ALgorithms

>## Kmean: is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters
>## DBSCAN: Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm and it can detect the anomoly in the data
